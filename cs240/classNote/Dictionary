Key -> value
Key must by unique !!!!
Secondary data structure.

Tranditionary keys in sorted order but ends up every time adding needs sorted. Look up time Log(n)

Probleams is    
    U: universal keys
    K sets of keys
    What if U is large when K is small
    
Array
    direct access table
    let A to size K 

Hash table
    Hash function (Not true hash implementing on any languages) Has to know the data sets before writing a hash function
    A[f(K)] = value 

    principle of unicorm hashing 
    Key % size  (mod hash)
    |key|^2 = and take the center value(sqare median,better than mod hash but require power of 10 size of set keys) 

    Imposiable to avoid collision
    miniment collision
