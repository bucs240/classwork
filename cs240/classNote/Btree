node has 
    max: t children
    min: t/2

Keys are sorted 
keys = t-1

Keys are always inserted at leaves

Two ways to inserted:
    Reative : require at least 3 traversal 
    Proative  using 1 traversal 
    Promoting the middle value up and create room to add 15

    most log(N) operation when adding the tree
B+ tree
Value only inserted in leaves
