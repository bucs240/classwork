Search Graph:
	Frontiers:
		White unvisited
		Grey frontier
		Red full visted 
	
	BFS: queue
		Check flags befreo,frontiers node push into queue
		everytime finished look ahead on every vertexs
		remove the vertexcs from the queue and grab the next item in the queue




Start from A:


BFS 
	Shortest path unweighted graph
	Uses queue
	Wide graph is not applicable,require a lot of memory

Depth First Search
	Check all possible path
	used in wide graph
	Does not gaurentee shortest path in 

Buliding a graph:
	Unvisted 
	Frontier: Geen
	Fully visited : Red


	BFS: 
		Use stack 

Shortest path:
	Figue out all the path in the graph
	initial a list and leg
