ris alwasy pointing to the next instruction 

addem: instruction writing for instruction fecthing
    addem's preamble
                    pushq %rbp
                    movq %rsp, %rbp
                    addem stack fram contain pointer to main function
    the red zone:
        128 bytes (16 addresses) below %rsp (below stack)
        The operating system would not mess the red zone
        return main change $rbp to the top of main stack fram 
        always below rsp

    Redundancy:  
        gcc parameter “-fomit-frame-pointer” removes use of %rbp, but
        then all references are relative to %rsp, which can change, so the
        code works, but becomes confusing
